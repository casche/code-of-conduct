Call of Duty® is committed to fighting toxicity and unfair play. In this continued effort, we have established a new franchise-wide Code of Conduct for Call of Duty.

Treat Everyone with Respect
We do not tolerate bullying or harassment, including derogatory comments based on race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, culture, faith, mental or physical abilities, or country of origin, or the amplification of any person, agenda, or movement that promotes discrimination or violence based on the above.

All members of our community should be treated with dignity and respect.

Communication with others, whether using text or voice chat, must be free of offensive or harmful language. Hate speech and discriminatory language is offensive and unacceptable, as is harassment and threatening another player.

COMPETE WITH INTEGRITY
Competitive integrity is core to the Call of Duty experience.

Progression is earned through good, clean gameplay. Cheating and griefing or other threats to fair play will not be tolerated.

You are responsible for how your account is used. The use of cheats, including third-party software, is unacceptable. Exploiting bugs or engaging in any activity that grants an unfair advantage is considered cheating.

Learn how we combat cheaters with RICOCHET Anti-Cheat™.

STAY VIGILANT
Working together we can keep the game fair and fun for all.

To promote an enjoyable gameplay experience, utilize in-game tools to report any incidents or inappropriate behaviors you encounter.
