We love our community and want to work together to create a safe and fun environment for everyone.
While our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service are in place to protect you within our games and services, there are a lot of other places where we interact with one another. It is important for us to uphold these standards. We'll actively enforce these standards across our owned channels, and we ask that you, our community, help to honor these standards across all other places where you may communicate with other players.
With that in mind, we ask that before you join our wonderful and welcoming community, regardless of where that might be, that you take a moment to review and understand our expectations for Community Standards.
Community Conduct
Regardless of where you’re speaking to one another, if you’re in our community we expect you to follow these simple rules: Remember:
Be excellent to each other! It’s ok to disagree, but you should always be civil to one another.
That means...
No Abusive Language - Abusive language and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. This includes comments directed at ZeniMax/Bethesda employees, moderators, your fellow community members, or other groups or companies. Abusive language includes slurs or discriminating speech in all forms, including but not limited to religion, creed, national origin, gender, age, or lifestyle.
No Hate Speech of any kind.
Do not use any LGBTQIA+ words or phrases in a derogatory manner.
Do not use any race, creed, national origin, gender, age, lifestyle or religion words or phrases in a derogatory manner.
Do not use any words or phrases on mental health in a derogatory manner.
Harassment, including witch-hunting, doxing, or the disclosure of personal information without the disclosed party’s consent, is strictly prohibited.
Disruptive behavior also includes deliberately spreading conspiracy theories or false info about ZeniMax/Bethesda and its game studios, games, or employees.
No Conspiracy Theories and/or Misinformation - We do not tolerate the deliberate and malicious spreading of false information or conspiracy theories of any kind in our communities. This includes false information about ZeniMax/Bethesda and its game studios, game(s), or employees.
Keep Foul Language to a minimum (and that includes circumventing any profanity filters).
Do Not Make Demands and Threats - Threats of real-life violence, in particular, are something we take very seriously and do not tolerate.
No Impersonation - Do not impersonate an employee, a moderator, any member of another group or company, or your fellow community members. This includes copying their profile picture to appear as them or posing as any official source or staff member.
Do not share Personal Information - For the sake of your own identity protection and personal privacy, we ask that you please do not share any personal information within our communities. This also goes for sharing another community member’s personal information — doing so is not only considered malicious behavior, but it is a violation of our Terms of Service and something we take very seriously.
No Trolling and Baiting - We do not allow trolling, baiting, or any type of provocation on our channels. If you feel like you are being trolled or baited, please report problem users through channel tools, or reach out to our Customer Support team.
Do not spam our channels - We appreciate your passion, but whether it’s our Discord Server, social channels, or live stream chats, please do not repeatedly post or spam.
Community Content
Our community has some of the most creative and talented members creating and sharing content, which includes not just your fan art and cosplay, but also your stories, screenshots, mods, and a multitude of other mediums. Before you share your content or the content of others, please keep in mind...
No NSFW Content – NSFW (“Not Suitable for Work”) content such as media, text, inappropriate names, or discussion is not permitted. If you need to ask if something is NSFW, the answer is usually, “yes.”
Be respectful of others’ content and contributions – If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all.
Credit the work – All fan content, unless posted directly by the artist, must have a source linked either through username or direct link to page. (We all love fan artists, let's give them credit!)
Do not steal the work of others – Please do not claim to have created art that is not your own.
Use caution when creating content from external IP – Our standards cover ZeniMax/Bethesda-owned brands. If your creations feature the work of other companies as well, it is your responsibility to refer to their own rules and guidelines and to ensure you have the right to use their IP.
Review our video policy - We encourage, and support, when our players create videos that use assets from our games for “Let’s Play,” tutorials, and other fan creations. Please familiarize yourself with our video policy. which addresses commonly asked questions from our creators.
MODS
Part of the modding community? Or would you like to be? We’d love to see your work! However, it’s important to take note of the standards and best practices before you submit your mod. Failure to adhere to these rules may result in your mod being removed.
Please review the following before you create and upload your mod to our community.
Only upload your creations. – Do not upload content from third party websites unless you have permission from the original creator. Some third-party websites let creators specify permissions for sharing content. It is your responsibility to ensure that your content is compliant with our Code of Conduct and Terms of Service.
If you feel your mod or a part of your mod has been stolen and uploaded, please submit a DMCA and make use of the REPORT feature on Bethesda.net.
When porting a mod to Bethesda.net, if you are not the author or co-author, you must include the following in your mod description:
Name of the original author(s)
Link to the source mod
Link to the permissions allowing you to port (if posted somewhere other than the source mod)
Permission to port must be publicly available on the site the mod is hosted. – This may be anywhere on the same site: mod description, mod comments, author profile, forum threads, et cetera. Some third-party mod hosts have specific places to include these permissions, but anywhere publicly available on the host is allowable.
To ensure transparency, we no longer accept permissions provided via social media, chat services, or screenshots of private conversations. Any ports with a “date created” before March 12, 2023 may continue to rely on these for permission, even if updated later.
Different mods have different permissions. – Make sure you have, and provide, appropriate permission.
Mods may have blanket permission for anyone to upload to other sites, or specifically to Bethesda.net, or specifically for consoles. These mods may be ported to Bethesda.net without further approval.
If a mod requires the original author(s) individually approve any ports, when the author provides permission they must name the account(s) approved to port the mod to Bethesda.net, or link to the Bethesda.net ports directly. Bear in mind, if you have different account names, or are brokering permission for another user, make sure the name of the uploader is given to the mod author so they may include this!
Some mods allow porting with limitation like not altering the content, or combining with other mods. Porters should check for this and gain additional approvals if required. Authors should not be surprised by how their content is being ported to Bethesda.net.
Always remember to be considerate of the original author(s)!
Create Quality Work – Always be updating and improving your work. The more mods you create, the better and faster your skills will improve. The best Modders in the community have a wide breadth of content under their belt.
Here are some resources to get started: Creation Kit Wiki, r/Skyrim Guide, AFK Mods.
Join the Modding Community! – The modding community has been around for over a decade and is a rich resource of information. Collaborate and learn from other Modders. Ask the community to help test your Mod on consoles.
Remember that the Code of Conduct and Community Standards apply to mods you create as well. – This means no Mature/Adult/NSFW or explicit mods may be uploaded or linked to within our community. We also do not allow uploading or linking of child killing mods or mods relating to copyrighted or trademarked content.
No Crowdfunding or Monetization mod projects is allowed. – This is outlined in Section 1 of the EULA that states “No Fees of Use”.
Best Practices for Sharing Mods:
Upload screenshots and box art for your Mod. Box Art dimensions are 260x260. Screenshot dimensions are 1315x740.
Be descriptive in naming your mod and in your mod description.
Keep the latest updates, news and known issues at the TOP of the description field so users see that information first.
Avoid generic names.
Chat about your mod in our Discord channels.
Create a website for your Mod! Treat it like your Mod's marketing product page.
Use social media to publicize your mods.
Talk about your Mod with our community on Discord: http://discord.gg/BethesdaStudios

Community Consequences
We take player safety very seriously within the Bethesda community, as we want all players to feel welcome. Therefore, any content or behavior that puts other players at risk or makes them feel unwelcome or unsafe has no place here. Those players will be actioned appropriately.
We always want to believe that all our players have the best intentions, so we will always try to work with our players and correct behavior that goes against our policies. Every suspension or other corrective action aims only to show what was wrong and what can be learned from a situation. When suspensions end, we welcome players back so they can contribute to our online communities. We know people make mistakes, and we believe lapses in judgment can be significant opportunities for growth. However, if users are unable to cooperate or learn from their infractions, some actions against them may be permanent.
Actioning against inappropriate conduct
If you violate these Bethesda community standards, you may find restrictions placed on your profile and/or device. This may extend to a suspension across a game account including but not limited to a Bethesda.net account, game accounts across Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Steam, or otherwise. Often, these restrictions will suspend a user from online interactions, removing their ability to repeat the offense across text/voice or other in-game systems.
Suitable content
While the subject matter of some of our games may be geared towards adults, content within our communities must be appropriate for all audiences, especially in communities without age gating. Therefore, we may remove any content that’s deemed inappropriate at any time. Depending on the type of content violation, this can also result in our restricting of certain features for the account that created or shared the content. For example, we’ll need to action an account that shares explicit materials on our Discord servers, or change a Bethesda.net username that features a NSFW word or phrase. If you see any content that is inappropriate within our communities, we ask that you report it to our Customer Support team to help us keep our communities safe.
Severe offenses
While we welcome all players to engage within our communities, we have zero tolerance for any offenses that we may deem severe. Behavior such as extreme hate speech towards other users, may result in a permanent suspension. Suspensions may also be permanent if the user ignores our attempts to correct negative behavior.
If a user receives a permanent suspension, they may lose access to Bethesda social channels, Bethesda-owned Discord servers, Twitch and YouTube functionality on Bethesda-owned channels, access to game features, and other services.
